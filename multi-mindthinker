Confronted with plethora of information, I can imagine two possible ways to solve the problem of information processing, e.g.

1 single tasking with full devotion to current task in front of your eyesight, without any distraction;
2 multi-tasking with distributed mind on multiple tasks, even though our eyes are looking at one task for the moment.

Probably, we are comfortable with the first manner (manner No. 1) of dealing with tasks.
However,
		Creatures and human beings can evolve, can't we?

I conjecture that
		Some people will evolve to be capable of multi-mind thinking and multi-tasking for multiple tasks in the future, with comparable
		performance as single taskers.
